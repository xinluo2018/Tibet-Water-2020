# Tibet-Water-2020
We produce monthly surface water maps in Tibet plateau in 2020 by using deep learning method and Sentinel-1 image.


## Highlights
### - We proposed a new gated multiscale ConvNet (GMNet) for surface water mapping based on Sentinel-1 image.
### - The monthly surface water dynamics are captured by using the new proposed GMNet.
